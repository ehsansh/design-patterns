# Design Patterns in JavaScript

In this repository, you'll find different JS files, each representing a different design pattern. At the top of each file, you'll find explanations for each pattern, presented in two ways: a simpler, easy-to-understand explanation and a more technical one. Additionally, I've included one or more JavaScript examples demonstrating the usage of each pattern.

Feel free to explore the files and examples to learn more about various design patterns in JavaScript.
